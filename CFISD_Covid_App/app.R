                                          the school year. 31,000 students were still learning 
                                          remotely at the end of the school 
                                          year, with high school students making 
                                          up the largest portion of remote learners.
                                          During the first semester, schools with
                                          high rates of students who are economically 
                                          disadvantaged saw lower rates of students

                                          schools, this gap persisted in the second

                                          those students are likely to need more
